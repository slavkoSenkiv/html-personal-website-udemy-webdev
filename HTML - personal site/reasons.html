    <h3>why am I learning web development</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Lifestile/Hobbie:</strong> <br>
				I like to think about myself 
				<ul>
					<li>developing some SaaS</li>
					<li>codding near the pool on Bali <br> 
						and to do so I need to learn how to code</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li><strong>Lifestile/Hobbie:</strong> <br>
				I just cought myself that coding and optimizing the code <br>
				feels the same way when I was drawing an image
			</li>

			<li><strong>Money:</strong><br> developers are <em>the most</em> 
				<ul>
					<li>wanted proffesion on the market 
						<br>(despite me beeing happy with my current possition) 
						<br> this is rather backup plan if I decide to pivot career
					</li>
					<li>paid proffesion on the market</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li><strong>Money:</strong><br> successfull SaaS can 
				<ul>
					<li>decrease time required to achieve financial independence</li>
					<li>make my financial independence more colorfull <br>
						with successfull SaaS on a side</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li><strong>Money: </strong><br> Both beeing a dev, or having SaaS <br>
				can lead to more monay so 
				<ul>
					<li>not rely on children</li>
					<li>get better health care now and later when I need it the most</li>
					<li>not to count coins when old</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
